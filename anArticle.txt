After BlackBerry’s rapid rally, not once but twice already this year, many Canadians are considering the company a top growth stock to buy today. When stocks rally rapidly, it understandably catches the attention of investors. But the fact that a company can rally quickly doesn’t make it a good investment.

In BlackBerry’s case, it actually could be used as an argument against investing in the stock. Each time it rallied this year, there were little, if any, fundamental factors that contributed to the rapid price growth.

This makes the stock look like pure speculation. Add the fact that it’s one of the most popular meme stocks on Reddit, and it almost surely looks like speculation at this point.

BlackBerry is a stock that does have growth potential in the long run. However, at this price today, and in the current economic environment, the stock is not worth a buy, especially if you’re looking for significant growth.

So, rather than invest in BlackBerry, here are two of the best Canadian growth stocks to buy today.
